## About

Among Ups is a multiplayer platform fighter game (but with a twist!).
With elements based on the popular game Among Us, AmongUps has two players fighting each other to win a round. At the end of each round, the winner of the round is presented with two power ups to improve their ability in the next round. The remaining powerup that the winner does not choose goes to the loser of the round, so strategy is the key! The first player to win 3 rounds wins the game.
